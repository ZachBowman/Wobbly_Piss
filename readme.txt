Wobbly Piss
2014 Cricketheads / Nightmare Games

Wobbly Piss was originally started as a weekend game jam challenge, the theme of which was to make a game that was deliberately bad or cheesy on purpose.

After establishing basic gameplay, I expanded on the concept as a learning experience for making an HTML5 / Javascript game.  I tried not to use any game engines or frameworks, keeping the results as close to straight Javascript as I could get.  I did need to use SoundJS to enable phone and tablet audio and jQuery for some user input.

While I learned a lot doing this, it was a huge pain and I won't be doing it again.  From here on out I'll be trying out different HTML5 game engines.
